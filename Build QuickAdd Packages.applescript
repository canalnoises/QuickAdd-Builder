-- Automatically build Jamf QuickAdd packages for multiple sites
-- Isaac Nelson <isaac.nelson@churchofjesuschrist.org>
-- Version 1.0 - 3 March 2018
-- Version 2.0 - 13 August 2019
-- Version 2.1 - 19 August 2019 (public release)
-- Version 2.2 - 24 Sep 2019 (internal only)
-- Version 2.3 - 24 Sep 2019 (Simplified by removing Python code, made it easier to disable signing, updated the descriptions of variables including more whitespace for readability, added notification after packages finish building )





-------------SET CUSTOM VARIABLES

set jamfServer1 to "Company's Jamf Pro Server" -- Change to the name of your production Jamf Pro server
set jamfServer2 to "Company's Jamf Pro Server" -- Change to the name of your beta Jamf Pro server
set jamfServer3 to "Company's Jamf Pro Server" -- Change to the name of your dev Jamf Pro server


set siteList to {"Site 1", "Site 2", "Site 3", "Site 4", "Site 5"} -- Replace Site 1, Site 2, etc. with the names of your Jamf Pro sites.


set signPKGs to "yes" --Set to "yes" if you want to sign the packages. Change to "no" if you don't want to sign them.


set certName to "Developer ID Installer: Your Company (ID number)" -- Change to the name of your Developer ID Installer certificate. If you don't want to sign the packages change the variable above as instructed and comment out the certName variable.


set defaultPath to "My External HD:Packages and Scripts:Enrollment Packages:" -- Change this to the default path you want Recon to use for saving packages. I have mine set to a network volume, so if that volume isn't mounted when the script runs it will default to the desktop.


-- If you want to change the naming convention for your QuickAdd packages, search the script for the first instance of "QuickAddName" and edit that line. The default is "QuickAdd-[site name]-[ProdLane/BetaLane/DevLane]-[Recon version]"






-------------NO NEED TO EDIT BELOW THIS LINE (unless you want to change the pkg naming convention as described above)

(*

-- Canâ€™t figure out how to get Recon to point to a different server. 
-- Modifying the com.jamfsoftware.recon and com.jamfsoftwarre.jss plists with the defaults command 
-- doesnâ€™t seem to change what server Recon points to, even though itâ€™s one of those same files that  
-- gets changed when you change the server in the Recon.app GUI. 
-- Instead we just grab the name of the Jamf Pro server from Recon.app's title bar

These are some attempts at watching the QuickAdd file to see when it's done being written. Wasn't able to get it to work, though.
