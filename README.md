# QuickAdd-Builder
Script to automate building QuickAdd packages for multiple Jamf Pro sites with Recon.app

I got tired of manually building separate QuickAdd packages for each site in my Jamf Pro server, so I wrote this script to automate the process.

There are a few variables that will need to be customized to make the script fit your needs. I've tried to put them all at the top so they're easy to find.
